# 🐍 Daily Python Practice

A simple, consistent repository to build **strong Python fundamentals** day by day.

This repo focuses on **small, daily Python concepts** — from absolute basics like printing output to core topics like strings, lists, conditionals, loops, and beyond.

The goal is **consistency over complexity**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Build a daily coding habit
* Strengthen Python fundamentals
* Create visible GitHub consistency (daily commits)
* Prepare for interviews, data roles, and software roles

Each file represents **one day of learning** and can be completed in **5–15 minutes**.
